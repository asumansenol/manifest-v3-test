The directory holding the manifest file can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state. To load an unpacked extension in developer mode, follow these steps:
- Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
- Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
- Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
- Loading an unpacked extension
- Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.
