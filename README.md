This test project is based on https://github.com/SimGus/chrome-extension-v3-starter. Only intercepts requests and logs details on the console.

The directory holding the manifest file can be added as an extension in developer mode in its current state. To load an unpacked extension in developer mode, follow these steps:
- Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
- Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
- Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.
- Loading an unpacked extension
- Ta-da! The extension has been successfully installed. Because no icons were included in the manifest, a generic icon will be created for the extension.
